# Material design icons fonts for Meteor

Material design icons are the official [icon set](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) from Google that are designed under the [material design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec).

This is a fork of the official repo and is set up with Meteor packaging info for releasing on atmospherejs.com.
